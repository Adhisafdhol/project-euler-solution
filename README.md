## Solution for project Euler problems

### **What is Project Euler**

_Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts graduates and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide. It includes 923 problems as of December 22 2024, with a new one added approximately every week. Problems are of varying difficulty, but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU time using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer._

**What is the goal of this project?**

The purpose of this project is to document my journey in solving the problems on the project Euler website. The project is a way for me to document the solutions to the problems I've solved throughout my journey to becoming a better problem-solver.

**Why am I doing project Euler?**

It is my intention to become a great developer and problem-solver. There are lots of problems that need solving on a day-to-day basis as a software developer. Project Euler provides a lot of interesting and challenging mathematical and coding problems that I can practice on. It is one of the efforts I am putting into my journey as a developer.
